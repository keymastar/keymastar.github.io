            <h2>Just the beginning</h2>
            <p>This site exists to explain the wonders of pizza to the masses. Hopefully, you enjoy pizza.</p>
            <p>Pizza has humble origins in Italy in the late 1700's after the tomato was introduced to the locals by Spanish Traders. It began as a simple tomato puree atop focaccia. It quickly became a neopolitan hit as a meal that could be produced cheaply and easily for the masses due to the availability of grain. Additional toppings, such as cheese, meats, and other vegetables, were only introduced later.</p>
